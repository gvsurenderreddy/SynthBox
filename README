This is SynthBox, an Archiso project that will (someday) build an .iso image that can be written to a thumb drive or CD, which should (ideally) boot into a 
live audio performance environment, showcasing some of th ebetter Linux audio synths and other tools.  My own tastes will most likely dictate what all is 
included, but suggestions are welcome.

All the code I've written is licensed under the GPLv2.  There are some files in here that came from other projects, which are all also under 
redistributable license.  I haven't yet taken note of the licenses of all such files;  If you're an author of one of those files, please let me know so I can 
get my attributions straight.  (This is my first open-source project, so please go easy on me with regard to licenses.)
