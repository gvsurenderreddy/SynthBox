What is SynthBox?

SynthBox is an ArchLinux-based audio production environment on a 
bootable CD, made using the Archiso utility.

There used to be a long-winded explanation here, but I figured the
easiest way to keep it up-to-date is to point to this page:

http://obsoleteaudio.org/software/synthbox

So go there for an up-to-date description.



Get the code

git clone http://github.com/seanbutnotheard/SynthBox.git

Building & Customizing

I recommend checking out the Archiso page on the Arch Wiki to get a
general sense of how an Archiso project works.  Essentially, if
you don't want to customize, just ...

cd SynthBox
make

... and Archiso will spit out an ISO file you can burn to CD or dd
onto a flash drive.  If I've done my part right (which I probably
haven't), that's all there is to it.
