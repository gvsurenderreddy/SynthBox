SynthBox TODO (before a real release)

1 - Address Ladish crashes (maybe use git PKGBUILD?)
2 - Make menu & WM Rules dynamically generated & Ladish-aware
3 - Make USB stick automatically mounted & symlinked to home dir (or maybe rsync backup script?)
4 - More synths to package:
    LinuxSampler
    Ingen
    PureData
    Csound/QuteCsound
