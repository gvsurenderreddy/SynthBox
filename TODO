SynthBox TODO (before a real release)

1 - Address Ladish crashes (maybe use git PKGBUILD?) --> fixed via patch.
2 - Get realtime kernel & rtirq script working  --> postponed.
3 - Determine appropriate pam memory limit at runtime
4 - Make menu & WM Rules dynamically generated & Ladish-aware
5 - Make USB stick automatically mounted & symlinked to home dir (or 
    maybe rsync backup script?)
6 - More synths/apps to package:
    Ingen
    PureData
    Csound/QuteCsound
    Tapeutape
    Guitarix and/or Rackarrack
    Superlooper
7 - Add CPU/MEM usage widgets to awesome panel
8 - Add code to add an appropriate mixer to the menu and change jack 
    backend if the defaults won't do
