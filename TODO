SynthBox TODO (before a real release)

1 - Address Ladish crashes (maybe use git PKGBUILD?)
2 - Get realtime kernel & rtirq script working
3 - Determine appropriate pam memory limit at runtime
4 - Make menu & WM Rules dynamically generated & Ladish-aware
5 - Make USB stick automatically mounted & symlinked to home dir (or maybe rsync backup script?)
6 - More synths to package:
    LinuxSampler
    Ingen
    PureData
    Csound/QuteCsound
    Tapeutape
7 - Add CPU/MEM usage widgets to awesome panel
